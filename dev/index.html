    <h1>Welcome to the HTML boilerplate!</h1>
    <h2>this is my common dev environment for the production of html/css/js based projects and websites.</h2><br />
    <p>
      this project contains bootstrap sass, browser-sync, jQuery, sass compiling, all controlled by gulp as the task runner.
    </p>
    <p>
      the first thing to do when you load this project is to replace the name in the index.html title tag and also in the package.json file (along with the project description and version).
    </p>
    <p>
      running "gulp" will compile the sass and host the index file in the dev folder using browser sync. any changes done to any of the html or css files will automatically reload the page to view the changes instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      when you're satisfied and want to create a simple production folder to give to a client or to push to a server, running "gulp build" will take the index.html (and any other html files you have) as well as the compiled single styles.css file and any asset files you have in the assets folder and create a new folder called dist. this folder will be ready to publish if you so wish.
    </p>
    
    <h1 style="text-align: center"> ENJOY!</h1>
